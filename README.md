# What is this? 

Lancer Combat Banner is a module that adds a visual display whenever the round changes and whenever a unit is activated. 

[combatbanner.webm](https://github.com/hiddenkrypt/LancerCombatBanner/assets/5739024/6a12e145-d142-4f04-9f4c-d3ab91a636be)


# Features

Color automatically changes with player and GM color. This can be overridden with a settings-defined color for all banners. 

Also creates a chat message when a character is activated in the combat tracker, and when a new round begins. This can be disabled in the settings.
